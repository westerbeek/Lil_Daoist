Foundation Building Stage: 
This is the first stage of cultivation, 
where one focuses on building a strong foundation of internal energy and physical strength. 
This involves performing various basic exercises and techniques, 
such as meditation, breathing exercises, and basic martial arts moves.

Qi-Cultivating Stage: 
In this stage, one learns to cultivate their internal energy (qi or ch'i) 
and develop their ability to control and manipulate it. 
This involves learning advanced breathing techniques 
and focusing on directing and increasing the flow of energy within the body.

Core Formation Stage: 
At this stage, one has developed a strong foundation and mastery of their internal energy, 
and can start to form a "core" of energy within their body. 
This allows them to perform more advanced techniques and gain greater control over their internal energy.

Nascent Soul Stage: 
In this stage, the character's internal energy has become so powerful 
and refined that it has the ability to manifest as a "nascent soul" or "spiritual embryo" 
outside of the body. 
This allows the character to perform incredible feats of strength and endurance.

Spirit Severing Stage: 
At this stage, 
the character's internal energy has reached a level of refinement and purity that 
allows them to sever the connection between their physical body and their spiritual essence. 
This enables them to exist purely as a spiritual entity and possess incredible power.

Immortal Ascension Stage: 
This is the final stage of cultivation, 
where the character has reached a state of enlightenment and ascends to a higher plane of existence. 
At this stage, 
the character is often depicted as possessing god-like powers and abilities.
