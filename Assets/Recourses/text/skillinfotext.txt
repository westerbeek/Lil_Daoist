Qi Sensing

A key part in the second step of cultivation,
Qi is everywhere but without the ability to sense it, the body is unable to draw it in.
Those adept at key sensing will be able to perceive things from great distance if they know what to look for.

Qi sensing is an important part of Qi gathering and Qi manipulation.

~~~
Qi Refining

Refining Qi is the step where you take the rough Qi that inhabits the mortal realm, and turn it into usable inner Qi.
Some cultivators however directly use unrefined Qi in order to speed up the Qi gathering and Qi manipulation progress.
While possible this can have many adverse effects.

There are also those that specialize in a specific form of Qi in order to boost their affinity with certain elements and laws.

However all under the heavens agree,
the purer your Qi is the higher your future potential in cultivation will be

~~~
Qi Absorption

One of if not the most important part of cultivation.

Being able to absorb Qi alone already has a rejuvinating effect, 
while those at the Qi gathering stage do not have a place to store it yet,
The absorption of Qi alone is essential for cleansing the body of impurities.

~~~
Strength

In order to step onto the road of cultivation,
In order to start drawing even the slightest strand of Qi in,
The body will need to be strong.

Without a strong vessel it's impossible to even take the first step.
The stronger the vessel the easier it will be to absorb and manipulate Qi.

~~~
Intelligence

In order to not deviate from ones path one will have to train their mind
Ones mind needs to be focussed and free of quarrel when cultivating.

Without a strong mind one is easily swayed and can fall into qi backflow or even develop inner demons.
The stronger ones mind the easier it will be to absorb and manipulate Qi.

~~~
Perception

Ones perception is highly important when out in the real world,
In battle to be able to perceive your enemy is key to defeating them
It can help you notice if you are being deceived and some masters even say
If you are able to perceive yourself you'll find what you are lacking

Perception is also key while inspecting and creating items.
